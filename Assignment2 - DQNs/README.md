## [Assignment 2 - Linear Value Function Approximation and Deep Q-Networks](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/assignment2/index.html)

This assignment contains written questions as well as coding assignments. We conduct Q-learning for a large state space scenario by implementing two function approximators: 
- Linear Approximator
- Convoluted Neural Networks (CNNs)
